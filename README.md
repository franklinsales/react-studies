# React Studies

This repository is just to me put React project's that I build during courses, tutorials and tests that I made.


## Structure Folders

The structure folders will be as follow:
 
 ``` bash
|-- Source Name (name of a course, title of a tutorial, or just test)
|    |-- Project Folder (the project)
```
Ex.:  

``` bash
|-- udemy-rect-complete
|    |-- todo-with-nodejs
```
## More

All source directories and project directories will be your own README.md files
