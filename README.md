# React Studies

This repository is just to me to put React projects that I built during courses, tutorials and tests that I made.


## Structure Folders

The directory structure will be as follow:
 
 ``` bash
|-- Source Name (name of a course, title of a tutorial, or just test)
|   |-- Project Folder (the project)
```
Ex.:  

``` bash
|-- udemy-rect-complete
|   |-- todo-with-nodejs
```
## More

All sources directories and projects directories will have your own README.md files
